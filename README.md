#  1. What is it?

ProbStat package is the main helper for students in Probability & Statistics. 
ProbStat methods allow users to deal  with complicated tasks and calculations in statistics and probability theory.

# 2. Main features
Here are just a few of the things that ProbStat does well:
- find all types of probability:
    - [Classic probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_definition_of_probability)
    - [Geometric probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_probability)
    - [Conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability)
- find probability by means of:
	- [Law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability)
	- [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)
	- [Bernoulli scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_scheme)
	- [De Moivre–Laplace theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre–Laplace_theorem)


- calculate statistics values: 
    - [Expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
    - [Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion)
    - [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)

- check whether events are: 
    - [Independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory))
    - [Disjoint](https://www.statisticshowto.com/disjoint-events/)


# 3. Where to get it?
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub, click [here](https://github.com/anafisa/C-module/tree/master/ProbStat%20module)






# 4. How to use it?
```python=
import probstat

probstat.probability(1,5)
>> 0.2

probstat.bernoulli_simple(0.7, 17, 11)
>>0.18

probstat.expected_value([0, 1, 2, 4], [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1])
>> 1.5

probstat.variance([0, 1, 2, 4], [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1])
>> 1.25

probstat.standard_deviation([0, 1, 2, 4], [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.1])
>> 1.12
```
