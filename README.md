ProbStat package is the main helper for students in Probability & Statistics. 
 ProbStat methods allow users to deal  with complicated tasks and calculations in statistics and probability theory.

# 2. Main features
Here are just a few of the things that ProbStat does well:
* find all types of [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)
* find probability using [law of total probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_probability)
* find probability using [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem)
* find probability using [Bernoulli scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_scheme)
* find probability using [De Moivre–Laplace theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre–Laplace_theorem)
* calculate [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value)
* calculate [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersion)
* calculate [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation)
